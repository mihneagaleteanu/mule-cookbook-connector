= Mule Cookbook Tutorial

The Cookbook is a service that helps users organize ingredients and recipes, so
that users can easily maintain recipes for the foods they like to prepare.
Using this service users can learn the features provided by the Anypoint DevKit
and incrementally learn to develop Connectors.

This project contains various client modules that expose the Cookbook service, that
can assist in developing SOAP based, REST based, or Java SDK based Connectors.
The module cookbook-connector showcases the usage of Devkit to build an SDK based
connector.

This project also has a basic server implementation provided, so that you can test connector while you develop. For detailed Documentation refer to link:http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-cookbook-tutorial/[Cookbook Tutorial]
